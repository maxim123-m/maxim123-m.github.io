	<p align='center'>So, where are ya? It's been a little while<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
	Let the vibe slide over me<br>
	This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
	When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
	I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
	The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
	Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah<br>
	Venom on my tongue, dependent at times<br>
	Poisonous vibrations, woah<br>
	Help my body run<br>
	I'm runnin' for my life<br>
	Runnin' for my life<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
	Let the vibe slide over me<br>
	This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
	When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
	I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
	The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
	Fall out of formation, woah<br>
	I plan my escape from walls they confined<br>
	Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh<br>
	Grows while I decay<br>
	I'm runnin' for my life<br>
	Runnin' for my life<br>
	Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life<br>
	Runnin' for my life<br>
	Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
	I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
	Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
	The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
	The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
	But now you double as a paper maker<br>
	I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight<br>
	And you in my life is like<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
	Let the vibe slide over me<br>
	This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
	When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
	I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
	The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
	Sippin' on straight chlorine</p>
